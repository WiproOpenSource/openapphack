Feature: Install OpenAppHack CLI

  Platform defaults as follows:
  * Ubuntu:  .profile, .bashrc
  * Fedora:  .bash_profile, .bashrc
  * OS X:    no skeleton files in user home (nice one Apple!)
  * Cygwin:  .bash_profile, .profile and .bashrc
  * Solaris: .profile, .bashrc
  * FreeBSD: .profile with NO .bashrc or bash pre-installed

  Order of precedence:
  Login shells (all new terminals) are initialised with the first file found in this order:
  * .bash_profile
  * .bash_login
  * .profile
  Non-login shells (like xterm shells) read the .bashrc file.

  Also important to note that usually the .bash_profile or .profile login shell files
  will check for the .bashrc file and invoke if present!

  Background:
    Given a user home exists

  Scenario: Creates and initialises .bash_profile on absence of login shell dot files
    Given the user home directory contains no ".bash_profile" file
    And the user home directory contains no ".profile" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the user home contains a ".bash_profile" file
    And the ".bash_profile" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Add Init Snippet to the .bash_profile if present
    Given the user home contains a ".bash_profile" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the ".bash_profile" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Add Init Snippet to the .profile if present
    Given the user home contains a ".profile" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the ".profile" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Creates and initialises .bashrc on absence of non-login dot files
    Given the user home directory contains no ".bashrc" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the user home contains a ".bashrc" file
    And the ".bashrc" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Always adds Init Snippet to the .bashrc
    Given the user home contains a ".bashrc" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the ".bashrc" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Creates and initialises .zshrc on absence of the file
    Given the user home directory contains no ".zshrc" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the user home contains a ".zshrc" file
    And the ".zshrc" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Always adds Init Snippet to the .zshrc
    Given the user home contains a ".zshrc" file
    When I run the installation script
    Then the ".zshrc" contains an Initialisation Snippet

  Scenario: Source the Initialisation Script on first invokation of the Init Snippet
    Given the user home contains a ".bash_profile" file
    And the ".bash_profile" contains an Initialisation Snippet
    When I open a new Login Shell
    Then the "app-init.sh" script is sourced once only

  Scenario: Do not Source the Initialisation Script on subsequent invocation of the Init Snippet
    Given the user home contains a ".bash_profile" file
    And the ".bash_profile" contains an Initialisation Snippet
    And the user home contains a ".bashrc" file
    And the ".bashrc" contains an Initialisation Snippet
    When I open a new Login Shell
    Then the "app-init.sh" script is sourced once only

  Scenario: Upgrade an installation without configuration
    Given an uninitialised system
    And the configuration file has not been primed
    When I run the installation script
    Then the configuration file is present
